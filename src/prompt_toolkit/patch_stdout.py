patch_stdout
============

This implements a context manager that ensures that print statements within
it won't destroy the user interface. The context manager will replace
`sys.stdout` by something that draws the output above the current prompt,
rather than overwriting the UI.

Usage::

    with patch_stdout(application):
        ...
        application.run()
        ...

Multiple applications can run in the body of the context manager, one after the
other.

    Replace `sys.stdout` by an :class:`_StdoutProxy` instance.

    application is curring, the behavior should be identical to writing to
    `sys.stdout` directly.

        is changed. Printing to stdout will be scheduled in the event loop
