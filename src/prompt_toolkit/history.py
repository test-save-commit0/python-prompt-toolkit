Implementations for the history of a `Buffer`.

NOTE: There is no `DynamicHistory`:
      This doesn't work well, because the `Buffer` needs to be able to attach
      an event handler to the event when a history entry is loaded. This
      loading can be done asynchronously and making the history swappable would
      probably break this.
