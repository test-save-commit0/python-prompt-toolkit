    Fuzzy completion.
    This wraps any other completer and turns it into a fuzzy completer.

    If the list of words is: ["leopard" , "gorilla", "dinosaur", "cat", "bee"]
    Then trying to complete "oar" would yield "leopard" and "dinosaur", but not
    the others, because they match the regular expression 'o.*a.*r'.
    Similar, in another application "djm" could expand to "django_migrations".

    The results are sorted by relevance, which is defined as the start position
    and the length of the match.

    Notice that this is not really a tool to work around spelling mistakes,
    like what would be possible with difflib. The purpose is rather to have a
    quicker or more intuitive way to filter the given completions, especially
    when many completions have a common prefix.

    Fuzzy algorithm is based on this post:
